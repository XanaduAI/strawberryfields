`Strawberry Fields <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io>`_ is a full-stack Python library for designing,
simulating, and optimizing continuous variable quantum
optical circuits.


Features
========

.. raw:: html

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields/master/doc/gallery/state_learner/StateLearning.gif" width="300px"  align="right">

* An open-source software architecture for **photonic quantum computing**

* Includes high-level functions for **solving practical problems** including **graph and network optimization**, **machine learning** and **chemistry**.

* Includes **quantum simulators** implemented using **NumPy** and **TensorFlow**—with built-in quantum compilation

* Future releases will target experimental backends, including **photonic quantum computing chips**

* Powers the `Strawberry Fields Interactive <https://strawberryfields.ai>`_ web app, which allows anyone to run a quantum computing simulation via **drag and drop**


Installation
============

Strawberry Fields requires Python version 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7 (3.8 is currently not support). Installation of Strawberry Fields, as well as all dependencies, can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install strawberryfields


TensorFlow support
------------------

To use Strawberry Fields with TensorFlow, version 1.3 of
TensorFlow is required. This can be installed alongside Strawberry Fields
as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install strawberryfields tensorflow==1.3

Or, to install Strawberry Fields and TensorFlow with GPU and CUDA support:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install strawberryfields tensorflow-gpu==1.3


Note that TensorFlow version 1.3 is only supported on Python versions
less than 3.7.


Getting started
===============

To see Strawberry Fields in action immediately, try out our `Strawberry Fields Interactive <https://strawberryfields.ai>`_ web application. Prepare your initial states, drag and drop gates, and watch your simulation run in real time right in your web browser.

For getting started with writing your own Strawberry Fields code, follow the `installation <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_static/install.html>`_ page to get Strawberry Fields up and running, then jump over to the `tutorials <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/tutorials.html>`_ to see what you can do.

Users interested in applications of photonic quantum computers should check out the `Graphs and Networks <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/graphs.html>`_, `Machine Learning <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/ml.html>`_ and `Chemistry <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/chemistry.html>`_ pages. Those wanting to dig deeper into the design of circuits can head to the `quantum circuits <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/circuits.html>`_ page.

Developers can head to the `development guide <https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/development_guide.html>`_ to see how they can contribute to Strawberry Fields.
