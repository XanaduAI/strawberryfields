    "## Background information: Gaussian states\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian state is one that can be described by a [Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function) in the phase space. For example, for a single mode Gaussian state, squeezed in the $x$ quadrature by squeezing operator $S(r)$, could be described by the following [Wigner quasiprobability distribution](Wigner quasiprobability distribution):\n",

    "$$W(x,p) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}e^{-2\\sigma^2(x-\\bar{x})^2 - 2(p-\\bar{p})^2/\\sigma^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ represents the **squeezing**, and $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{p}$ are the mean **displacement**, respectively. For multimode states containing $N$ modes, this can be generalised; Gaussian states are uniquely defined by a [multivariate Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution), defined in terms of the **vector of means** ${\\mu}$ and a **covariance matrix** $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The position and momentum basis\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a single mode in the position and momentum quadrature basis (the default for Strawberry Fields). Assuming a Gaussian state with displacement $\\alpha = \\bar{x}+i\\bar{p}$ and squeezing $\\xi = r e^{i\\phi}$ in the phase space, it has a vector of means and a covariance matrix given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "“If you need to wait exponential time for your single photon sources to emit simultaneously, then there would seem to be no advantage over classical computation. This is the reason why so far, boson sampling has only been demonstrated with 3-4 photons. When faced with these problems, until recently, all we could do was shrug our shoulders.” - [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1579)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "While [boson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling) allows the experimental implementation of a quantum sampling problem that it countably hard classically, one of the main issues it has in experimental setups is one of **scalability**, due to its dependence on an array of simultaneously emitting single photon sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, most physical implementations of boson sampling make use of a process known as [Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion) to generate the single photon source inputs. Unfortunately, this method is non-deterministic - as the number of modes in the apparatus increases, the average time required until every photon source emits a simultaneous photon increases *exponentially*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simulate a *deterministic* single photon source array, several variations on boson sampling have been proposed; the most well known being scattershot boson sampling ([Lund, 2014](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.100502)). However, a recent boson sampling variation by [Hamilton et al.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.170501) negates the need for single photon Fock states altogether, by showing that **incident Gaussian states** - in this case, single mode squeezed states - can produce problems in the same computational complexity class as boson sampling. Even more significantly, this negates the scalability problem with single photon sources, as single mode squeezed states can be easily simultaneously generated experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from changing the input states from single photon Fock states to Gaussian states, the Gaussian boson sampling scheme appears quite similar to that of boson sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $N$ single mode squeezed states $\\left|{\\xi_i}\\right\\rangle$, with squeezing parameters $\\xi_i=r_ie^{i\\phi_i}$, enter an $N$ mode linear interferometer with unitary $U$.\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. The output of the interferometer is denoted $\\left|{\\psi'}\\right\\rangle$. Each output mode is then measured in the Fock basis, $\\bigotimes_i n_i\\left|{n_i}\\middle\\rangle\\middle\\langle{n_i}\\right|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, we can absorb the squeezing parameter $\\phi$ into the interferometer, and set $\\phi=0$ for convenience. The covariance matrix **in the creation and annihilation operator basis** at the output of the interferometer is then given by:\n",
    "\n",
