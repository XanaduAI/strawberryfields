Backend specifications
======================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.devicespecs`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.devicespecs

This module implements the :class:`~.DeviceSpecs` class, an abstract base
data class used to store details and specifications of the Strawberry Fields
backend and devices.

These details are used by the :class:`~.Program` class when validating and
compiling quantum programs. By querying the data class corresponding to the
requested device/backend, the :class:`~.Program` will be able to:

1. **Validate** that the program has the correct number of modes, and consists
   of valid quantum operations for that device.

2. **Compile** the program to match the backend topology, making use
   of allowed decompositions along the way.

To access the correct specifications dataclass, :attr:`~.backend_specs` provides
a dictionary mapping the backend shortname to the correct dataclass.
