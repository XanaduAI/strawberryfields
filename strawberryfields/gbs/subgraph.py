Dense subgraph identification
=============================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.subgraph`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.subgraph

This module provides tools for users to find dense subgraphs of different sizes.
The search heuristic in this module works by resizing a collection of starting subgraphs and
keeping track of the densest identified. The starting subgraphs can be selected by sampling from
GBS, resulting in candidates that are likely to be dense :cite:`arrazola2018using`.

An accompanying tutorial can be found :ref:`here <gbs-subgraph-tutorial>`.

Algorithm
---------

The heuristic algorithm provided proceeds as follows. Each starting subgraph :math:`s` is resized
to a range of sizes :math:`\{k\}_{k_{\min}}^{k_{\max}}`, resulting in the subgraphs
:math:`s_{k}`. For a given size :math:`k`, a collection of the densest :math:`n` subgraphs
identified is recorded, meaning that :math:`s_{k}` is added to the collection only if it has
sufficient density.

.. autosummary::
    search

This algorithm returns a dictionary over the range of sizes specified, with each value being the
collection of densest-:math:`k` subgraphs. This collection is a list of tuple pairs specifying
the subgraph density and nodes.

Subgraph resizing
-----------------

The key element of the :func:`search` algorithm is the resizing of each subgraph, allowing a
range of subgraph sizes to be tracked. Resizing proceeds by greedily adding or removing nodes to
a subgraph one-at-a-time. Node selection is carried out by picking the node with the greatest
or least degree with respect to to the subgraph, with ties settled uniformly at random.

.. autosummary::
    resize

This function returns a dictionary over the range of sizes specified, with each value being the
corresponding resized subgraph.

    This function uses a greedy approach to iteratively add or remove nodes one at a time to an
    input subgraph to reach the range of sizes specified by ``min_size`` and ``max_size``.

    When growth is required, the algorithm examines all nodes from the remainder of the graph as
    candidates and adds the single node with the highest degree relative to the rest of the
    subgraph. This results in a graph that is one node larger, and if growth is still required,
    the algorithm performs the procedure again.

    When shrinking is required, the algorithm examines all nodes from within the subgraph as
    candidates and removes the single node with lowest degree relative to the subgraph. In both
    growth and shrink phases, ties for addition/removal with nodes of equal degree are settled by
    uniform random choice.
