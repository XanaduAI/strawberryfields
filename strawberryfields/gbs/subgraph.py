Dense subgraph identification
=============================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.subgraph`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.subgraph

This module provides tools for users to identify dense subgraphs. Current functionality focuses
on the densest-:math:`k` subgraph problem :cite:`arrazola2018using`, which is NP-hard. This
problem considers an undirected graph :math:`G = (V, E)` of :math:`N` nodes :math:`V` and a list
of edges :math:`E`, and sets the objective of finding a :math:`k`-vertex subgraph with the
greatest density. In this setting, subgraphs :math:`G[S]` are defined by nodes :math:`S \subset
V` and corresponding edges :math:`E_{S} \subseteq E` that have both endpoints in :math:`S`. The
density of a subgraph is given by

.. math:: d(G[S]) = \frac{2 |E_{S}|}{|S|(|S|-1)},

where :math:`|\cdot|` denotes cardinality, and the densest-:math:`k` subgraph problem can be
written succinctly as

.. math:: {\rm argmax}_{S \in \mathcal{S}_{k}} d(G[S])

with :math:`\mathcal{S}_{k}` the set of all possible :math:`k` node subgraphs. This problem grows
combinatorially with :math:`{N \choose k}` and is NP-hard in the worst case.

Heuristics
----------

The :func:`search` function provides access to heuristic algorithms for finding
approximate solutions. At present, random search is the heuristic algorithm provided, accessible
through the :func:`random_search` function. This algorithm proceeds by randomly generating a set
of :math:`k` vertex subgraphs and selecting the densest.

Subgraph resizing
-----------------

Subgraphs sampled from GBS are not guaranteed to be of size :math:`k`, even if this is the mean
photon number. On the other hand, the densest-:math:`k` subgraph problem requires graphs of fixed
size to be considered. This means that heuristic algorithms at some point must resize the sampled
subgraphs. Resizing functionality is provided by the following function.

    """Find a dense subgraph of a given size.

    This function returns the densest `node-induced subgraph
    <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Vertex-InducedSubgraph.html>`__ of size ``nodes`` after
    multiple repetitions. It uses heuristic optimization that combines search space exploration
    with local searching. The heuristic method can be set with the ``options`` argument. Methods
    can contain stochastic elements, where randomness can come from distributions including GBS.

    All elements of the heuristic can be controlled with the ``options`` argument, which should be a
    dict-of-dicts where the first level specifies the option type as a string-based key,
    with corresponding value being a dictionary of options for that type. The option types are:

    - ``"heuristic"``: specifying options used by optimization heuristic; corresponding
      dictionary of options explained further :ref:`below <heuristic>`
    - ``"backend"``: specifying options used by backend quantum samplers; corresponding
      dictionary of options explained further in :mod:`~strawberryfields.gbs.sample`
    - ``"resize"``: specifying options used by resizing method; corresponding dictionary of
      options explained further in :mod:`~strawberryfields.gbs.resize`
    - ``"sample"``: specifying options used in sampling; corresponding dictionary of options
      explained further in :mod:`~strawberryfields.gbs.sample`

    If unspecified, a default set of options is adopted for a given option type.

              selected and the densest one is chosen (default)
            - *callable*: accepting ``(graph: nx.Graph, nodes: int, iterations: int, options:
              dict)`` as arguments and returning ``Tuple[float, list]`` corresponding to the
              density and list of nodes of the densest subgraph found, see :func:`random_search`

    This function uses a greedy approach to iteratively add or remove nodes one at a time to an
    input subgraph to reach the range of sizes specified by ``min_size`` and ``max_size``.

    When growth is required, the algorithm examines all nodes from the remainder of the graph as
    candidates and adds-in the single node with the highest degree relative to the rest of the
    subgraph. This results in a graph that is one node larger,  and if growth is still required
    the algorithm performs the above procedure again.

    When shrinking is required, the algorithm examines all nodes from within the subgraph as
    candidates and removes the single node with lowest degree relative to the subgraph. In both
    growth and shrink phases, ties for addition/removal with nodes of equal degree are settled by
    uniform random choice.
