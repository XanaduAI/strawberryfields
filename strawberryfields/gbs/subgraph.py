Dense subgraph identification
=============================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.dense`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.dense

This module provides tools for users to identify dense subgraphs. Current functionality focuses
on the densest-:math:`k` subgraph problem :cite:`arrazola2018using`, which is NP-hard. This
problem considers an undirected graph :math:`G = (V, E)` of :math:`N` nodes :math:`V` and a list
of edges :math:`E`, and sets the objective of finding a :math:`k`-vertex subgraph with the
greatest density. In this setting, subgraphs :math:`G[S]` are defined by nodes :math:`S \subset
V` and corresponding edges :math:`E_{S} \subseteq E` that have both endpoints in :math:`S`. The
density of a subgraph is given by

.. math:: d(G[S]) = \frac{2 |E_{S}|}{|S|(|S|-1)},

where :math:`|\cdot|` denotes cardinality, and the densest-:math:`k` subgraph problem can be
written succinctly as

.. math:: {\rm argmax}_{S \in \mathcal{S}_{k}} d(G[S])

with :math:`\mathcal{S}_{k}` the set of all possible :math:`k` node subgraphs. This problem grows
combinatorially with :math:`{N \choose k}` and is NP-hard in the worst case.

Heuristics
----------

The :func:`search` function provides access to heuristic algorithms for finding
approximate solutions. At present, random search is the heuristic algorithm provided, accessible
through the :func:`random_search` function. This algorithm proceeds by randomly generating a set
of :math:`k` vertex subgraphs and selecting the densest. Sampling of subgraphs can be achieved
both uniformly at random and also with a quantum sampler programmed to be biased toward
outputting dense subgraphs.

Subgraph resizing
-----------------

Subgraphs sampled from GBS are not guaranteed to be of size :math:`k`, even if this is the mean
photon number. On the other hand, the densest-:math:`k` subgraph problem requires graphs of fixed
size to be considered. This means that heuristic algorithms at some point must resize the sampled
subgraphs. Resizing functionality is provided by the following functions.

    This function returns the densest `node-induced subgraph
    <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Vertex-InducedSubgraph.html>`__ of size ``nodes`` after
    multiple repetitions. It uses heuristic optimization that combines search space exploration
    with local searching. The heuristic method can be set with the ``options`` argument. Methods
    can contain stochastic elements, where randomness can come from distributions including GBS.

    All elements of the heuristic can be controlled with the ``options`` argument, which should be a
    dict-of-dicts where the first level specifies the option type as a string-based key,
    with corresponding value being a dictionary of options for that type. The option types are:

    - ``"heuristic"``: specifying options used by optimization heuristic; corresponding
      dictionary of options explained further :ref:`below <heuristic>`
    - ``"backend"``: specifying options used by backend quantum samplers; corresponding
      dictionary of options explained further in :mod:`~strawberryfields.gbs.sample`
    - ``"resize"``: specifying options used by resizing method; corresponding dictionary of
      options explained further in :mod:`~strawberryfields.gbs.resize`
    - ``"sample"``: specifying options used in sampling; corresponding dictionary of options
      explained further in :mod:`~strawberryfields.gbs.sample`
