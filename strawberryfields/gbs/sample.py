Sampling functions
==================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.sample`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.sample

This module provides functionality for generating samples from both a quantum device and the
uniform distribution.

Gaussian boson sampling (GBS)
-----------------------------

The :func:`sample` function allows users to simulate Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) by
choosing a symmetric input matrix to sample from :cite:`bradler2018gaussian`. For a symmetric
:math:`N \times N` input matrix :math:`A`, corresponding to an undirected graph,
an :math:`N`-mode GBS device with threshold detectors generates samples that are binary strings
of length ``N``. Various problems can be encoded in the matrix :math:`A` so that the output
samples are informative and can be used as a form of randomness to improve solvers, as outlined
in Refs. :cite:`arrazola2018using` and :cite:`arrazola2018quantum`.

On the other hand, the :func:`uniform` function allows users to generate samples where a
subset of modes are selected using the uniform distribution. A utility function
:func:`modes_from_counts` is also provided to convert between two ways to represent samples from
the device.

Subgraph sampling through GBS
-----------------------------

This module also provides functionality for sampling of subgraphs from undirected graphs. The
:func:`subgraphs` function generates raw samples from :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.sample`
and converts them to subgraphs using :func:`to_subgraphs`. Sampling can be generated both from
GBS and by using the uniform distribution.

    r"""Generate samples from GBS

    Perform quantum sampling of adjacency matrix :math:`A` using the Gaussian boson sampling
    algorithm.

    Sampling can be controlled with the optional ``backend_options`` argument, which should be a
    dict containing any of the following:

    .. glossary::

        key: ``"remote"``, value: *bool*
            Performs sampling on a remote server if ``True``. Remote sampling is
            required for sampling on hardware. If not specified, sampling will be performed locally.

        key: ``"backend"``, value: *str*
            Requested backend for sampling. Available backends are listed in
            ``QUANTUM_BACKENDS``, these are:

            - ``"gaussian"``: for simulating the output of a GBS device using the
              :mod:`strawberryfields.backends.gaussianbackend`

        key: ``"threshold"``, value: *bool*
            Performs sampling using threshold (on/off click) detectors if ``True``
            or using photon number resolving detectors if ``False``. Defaults to ``True`` for
            threshold sampling.

        key: ``"postselect"``, value: *int*
            Causes samples with a photon number or click number less than the
            specified value to be filtered out. Defaults to ``0`` if unspecified, resulting in no
            postselection. Note that the number of samples returned in :func:`sample` is
            still equal to the ``samples`` parameter.

    Args:
        A (array): the (real or complex) :math:`N \times N` adjacency matrix to sample from
        n_mean (float): mean photon number
