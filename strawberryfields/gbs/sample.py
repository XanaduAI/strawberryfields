Sampling functions
==================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.sample`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.sample

This module provides functionality for generating samples from GBS.

Gaussian boson sampling (GBS)
-----------------------------

The :func:`sample` function allows users to simulate Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) by
choosing a symmetric input matrix to sample from :cite:`bradler2018gaussian`. For a symmetric
:math:`N \times N` input matrix :math:`A`, corresponding to an undirected graph,
an :math:`N`-mode GBS device with threshold detectors generates samples that are binary strings
of length ``N``. Various problems can be encoded in the matrix :math:`A` so that the output
samples are informative and can be used as a form of randomness to improve solvers, as outlined
in Refs. :cite:`arrazola2018using` and :cite:`arrazola2018quantum`.

A utility function :func:`modes_from_counts` is also provided to convert between two ways to
represent samples from the device.

    sample
    postselect
    seed

Subgraph sampling through GBS
-----------------------------

This module also provides functionality for sampling subgraphs from undirected graphs. The
:func:`to_subgraphs` function can be used to convert samples to subgraphs.

    to_subgraphs
    modes_from_counts

def modes_from_counts(s: list) -> list:
    r"""Convert a sample of photon counts to a list of modes where photons are detected.

    There are two main methods of representing a sample. In the first, the number of photons
    detected in each mode is specified. In the second, the modes in which each photon was detected
    are listed. Since there are typically fewer photons than modes, the second method gives a
    shorter representation.

    This function converts from the first representation to the second. Given an :math:`N` mode
    sample :math:`s=\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{N}\}` of photon counts in each mode with total photon
    number :math:`k`, this function returns a list of modes :math:`m=\{m_{1},m_{2},\ldots,
    m_{k}\}` where photons are detected.
