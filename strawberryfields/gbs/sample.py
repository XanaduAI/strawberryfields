Sampling functions
==================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.sample`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.sample

This module provides functionality for generating GBS samples using classical simulators.

An accompanying tutorial can be found :ref:`here <gbs-sample-tutorial>`.

Generating samples
------------------

An :math:`M` mode GBS device can be programmed by specifying an :math:`(M \times M)`-dimensional
symmetric matrix :math:`A` :cite:`bradler2018gaussian`. Running this device results in samples
that carry relevant information about the encoded matrix :math:`A`. When sampling, one must also
specify the mean number of photons in the device, the form of detection used at the output:
threshold detection or photon-number-resolving (PNR) detection, as well as the amount of loss.

The :func:`sample` function provides a simulation of sampling from GBS:

.. autosummary::
    sample

Here, each output sample is an :math:`M`-dimensional list. If threshold detection is used
(``threshold = True``), each element of a sample is either a zero (denoting no photons detected)
or a one (denoting one or more photons detected), conventionally called a "click".
If photon-number resolving (PNR) detection is used (``threshold = False``) then elements of a
sample are non-negative integers counting the number of photons detected in each mode. The ``loss``
parameter allows for simulation of photon loss in the device, which is the most common form of
noise in quantum photonics. Here, ``loss = 0`` describes ideal loss-free GBS, while generally
``0 <= loss <= 1`` describes the proportion of photons lost while passing through the device.

Samples can be postselected based upon their total number of photons or clicks and the ``numpy``
random seed used to generate samples can be fixed:

.. autosummary::
    postselect
    seed

.. _decomposition:

The :func:`vibronic` function allows users to sample Gaussian states for computing molecular
vibronic spectra.

.. autosummary::
    vibronic

Generating subgraphs
--------------------

There are two forms to represent a sample from a GBS device:

1. In the form returned by :func:`sample`, each sample is a length :math:`M` list of counts in
   each mode, e.g., the sample ``[2, 1, 2, 0, 1]`` denotes two photons in mode 0,
   1 photon in mode 1, and so forth.

2. The alternative representation is a list of modes where photons or clicks were observed, e.g.,
   the above sample can be written alternatively as ``[0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4]``.

Converting from the former representation to the latter can be achieved with:

.. autosummary::
    modes_from_counts

Graphs can be encoded into GBS by setting the adjacency matrix to be :math:`A`. Resultant samples
can then be used to pick out nodes from the graph to form a subgraph. If threshold detection is
used, any nodes that click are selected as part of the subgraph. For example, if a sample is
``[1, 1, 1, 0, 1]`` then the corresponding subgraph has nodes ``[0, 1, 2, 4]``. This can be found
using:

>>> modes_from_counts([1, 1, 1, 0, 1])
[0, 1, 2, 4]

A collection of GBS samples from a graph, given by :func:`sample` in the first form, can be
converted to subgraphs using:

.. autosummary::
    to_subgraphs

A typical workflow would be:

>>> g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(5, 0.7)
>>> a = nx.to_numpy_array(g)
>>> s = sample(a, 3, 4)
>>> s = to_subgraphs(s, g)
[[0, 2], [0, 1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1]]

The subgraphs sampled from GBS are likely to be dense :cite:`arrazola2018using`, motivating their
use within heuristics for problems such as maximum clique (see :mod:`~.gbs.clique`).
