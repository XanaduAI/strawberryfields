GBS Datasets
============

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.gbs.data`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.gbs.data

This module provides access to pre-calculated datasets of simulated GBS samples generated from a
range of input graphs. Each dataset corresponds to a set of samples generated from a fixed graph
with corresponding values for:

- ``n_mean``: mean number of photons in the GBS device

- ``n_max``: maximum number of photons allowed in any sample

-  ``threshold``: flag to indicate whether samples are generated with threshold detection or
   with photon-number-resolving detectors

- ``n_samples``: total number of samples in the dataset

- ``modes``: number of modes in the GBS device or, equivalently, number of nodes in the graph

Datasets are available as classes. The following graphs and datasets are provided:

- **Planted graph**: A 30-node graph with a dense 10-node subgraph planted inside
  :cite:`arrazola2018using`.

  .. image:: ../../_static/planted.png
        :align: center
        :width: 300px

  Provided by the :class:`Planted` Dataset with attributes ``n_mean = 6``, ``n_max = 14``,
  ``threshold = True``, ``n_samples = 50000``, ``modes = 30``.

Loading data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the :class:`Planted` class as an example to show how to interact with the datasets. Datasets
can be loaded by running:

>>> data = Planted()

Simply use indexing and slicing to access samples from the dataset:

>>> sample_3 = data[3]
>>> samples = data[:10]

Datasets also contain metadata relevant to the GBS setup:

>>> data.n_mean
6

>>> len(data)
50000

The number of photons or clicks in each sample is available using the :meth:`Dataset.counts` method:

>>> data.counts()
[2, 0, 8, 11, ... , 6]

For example, we see that the ``data[3]`` sample had 11 clicks.

Datasets
^^^^^^^^

The :class:`Dataset` class provides the base functionality from which all datasets such as
:class:`Planted` inherit.
