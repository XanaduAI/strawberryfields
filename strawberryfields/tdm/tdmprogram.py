class TDMProgram(sf.Program):
    r"""Represents a photonic quantum circuit in the time domain encoding.

    The ``TDMProgam`` class provides a context manager for easily defining
    a single time-bin of the time domain algorithm. As with the standard
    :class:`~.Program`, Strawberry Fields operations are appended to the
    time domain program using the Python-embedded Blackbird syntax.

    Once created, time domain programs can be executed on Strawberry Fields'
    suite of built-in simulators in an efficient manner, or submitted
    to be executed on compatible hardware.

    Args:
        N (int or Sequence[int]): If an integer, the number of concurrent (or 'alive')
            modes in each time bin. Alternatively, a sequence of integers
            may be provided, corresponding to the number of concurrent modes in
            the possibly multiple bands in the circuit.
        name (str): the program name (optional)

    **Example**

    Below, we create a time domain program with 2 concurrent modes:

    >>> import strawberryfields as sf
    >>> from strawberryfields import ops
    >>> prog = sf.TDMProgram(N=2)

    Once created, we can construct the program using the ``prog.context()``
    context manager.

    >>> with prog.context([1, 2], [3, 4], copies=3) as (p, q):
    ...     ops.Sgate(0.7, 0) | q[1]
    ...     ops.BSgate(p[0]) | (q[0], q[1])
    ...     ops.MeasureHomodyne(p[1]) | q[0]

    If we print out this program, we see that the time domain program
    has automated the process of repeating the single time-bin sequence
    constructed above:

    >>> prog.print()
    Sgate(0.32, 0) | (q[1])
    BSgate(1, 0) | (q[0], q[1])
    MeasureHomodyne(3) | (q[0])
    Sgate(0.32, 0) | (q[0])
    BSgate(2, 0) | (q[1], q[0])
    MeasureHomodyne(4) | (q[1])
    Sgate(0.32, 0) | (q[1])
    BSgate(1, 0) | (q[0], q[1])
    MeasureHomodyne(3) | (q[0])
    Sgate(0.32, 0) | (q[0])
    BSgate(2, 0) | (q[1], q[0])
    MeasureHomodyne(4) | (q[1])
    Sgate(0.32, 0) | (q[1])
    BSgate(1, 0) | (q[0], q[1])
    MeasureHomodyne(3) | (q[0])
    Sgate(0.32, 0) | (q[0])
    BSgate(2, 0) | (q[1], q[0])
    MeasureHomodyne(4) | (q[1])

    Note the 'shifting' of the measured registers --- this optimization allows
    for time domain algorithms to be simulated in memory much more efficiently:

    >>> eng = sf.Engine("gaussian")
    >>> results = eng.run(prog)

    The engine automatically takes this mode shifting into account; returned samples
    will always be transformed to match the modes specified during construction:

    >>> print(results.all_samples)
    {0: [array([1.26208025]), array([1.53910032]), array([-1.29648336]),
    array([0.75743215]), array([-0.17850101]), array([-1.44751996])]}

    Note that, unlike the standard :class:`~.Program`,
    the TDM context manager has both required and essential arguments:

    * Positional arguments are used to pass sequences of gate arguments
      to apply per time-bin. Within the context, these are accessible via the ``p``
      context variable; ``p[i]`` corresponds to the ``i``-th positional
      arguments.

      All positional arguments corresponding to sequences of gate arguments
      **must be the same length**. This length determines how many time-bins
      are present in the TDM program.

      If the ``p`` variable is not used, the gate argument is assumed to be **constant**
      across all time-bins.

    * ``copies=1`` *(int)*: the number of times to repeat the time-domain program.
      For example, if a sequence of 10 gate arguments is provided, and ``copies==15``,
      then there will be a total of :math:`10\times 15` time bins in the time domain
      program. The sequence corresponding to the gate arguments is repeated ``copies``
      number of times.

    * ``shift="default"`` *(str or int)*: Defines how the qumode register is shifted at the end of
      each time bin. If set to ``"default"``, the qumode register is shifted such that each measured
      qumode reappears as a fresh mode at the beginning of the subsequent time bin. This is
      equivalent to a measured qumode being removed from the representation (by measurement) and a
      new one being added (by a light source). If set to an integer value, the register will shift
      by a step size of this integer at the end of each time bin.
