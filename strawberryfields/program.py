Quantum programs
================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.program`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.program

This module implements the :class:`Program` class which acts as a representation for quantum circuits.
The Program object also acts as a context for defining the quantum circuit using the Python-embedded Blackbird syntax.

A typical use looks like

.. include:: example_use.rst

The Program objects keep track of the state of the quantum register they act on, using a dictionary of :class:`RegRef` objects.
The currently active register references can be accessed using the :meth:`~Program.register` method.


Program methods
---------------

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.program.Program

   context
   register
   num_subsystems
   __len__
   can_follow
   append

The following are internal Program methods. In most cases the user should not
call these directly.

Quantum circuit representation
------------------------------

The :class:`Command` instances in the circuit form a
`strict partially ordered set <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Strict_and_non-strict_partial_orders>`_
in the sense that the order in which the operations have to be executed is usually not completely fixed.
For example, operations acting on different subsystems always commute with each other.
We denote :math:`a < b` if :math:`a` has to be executed before :math:`b`.
Each strict partial order corresponds to a
`directed acyclic graph <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_ (DAG),
and the transitive closure of any DAG is a strict partial order.
During the optimization three different (but equivalent) representations of the circuit are used.

* Initially, the circuit is represented as a Command queue (list), listing the Commands in
  the temporal order they are applied.
* The second representation, grid, essentially mimics a quantum circuit diagram.
  It is a mapping from subsystem indices to lists of Commands touching that subsystem,
  where each list is temporally ordered.
* Finally, the quantum circuit can be represented using a DAG by making each Command a node,
  and drawing an edge from each Command to all its immediate followers along each wire it touches.
  It can be converted back into a command queue by popping a maximal element until the graph
  is empty, that is, consuming it in a topological order.
  Note that a topological order is not always unique, there may be several equivalent topological orders.

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.program.Program

The three representations can be converted to each other
using the methods :func:`_list_to_grid`, :func:`_grid_to_DAG` and :func:`_DAG_to_list`.


Optimizer
---------

The purpose of the optimizer part of the compiler is to simplify the circuit
to make it cheaper and faster to execute. Different backends might require
different types of optimization, but in general the fewer operations a circuit has,
the faster it should run. The optimizer thus should convert the circuit into a
simpler circuit while preserving the probability distributions of the measurement results.
The optimization utilizes the abstract algebraic properties of the gates,
and in no point should require a matrix representation.

Currently the optimization is very simple. It

* merges neighboring gates belonging to the same gate family and acting on the same sequence of subsystems
* cancels neighboring pairs of a gate and its inverse

class Program:
    """Represents a quantum circuit.

    A quantum circuit is a set of quantum operations applied in a specific order
    to a set of subsystems (represented by wires in the circuit diagram) of the quantum register.
    The Program class represents a quantum circuit in general as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    whose nodes are :class:`Command` instances, and each (directed) edge in the graph
    corresponds to a specific wire along which the two associated Commands are connected.

    Program instances also act as context managers (and the context itself) for inputting
    quantum circuits using a :code:`with` block and :class:`Operation` instances.
    The contexts may not be nested.

    The quantum circuit is inputted by using the :meth:`~strawberryfields.ops.Operation.__or__`
    methods of the quantum operations, which call the :meth:`append` method of the Program.
    :meth:`append` checks that the register references are valid and then
    adds a new :class:`.Command` instance to the Program.

    The ``New`` and ``Del`` operations modify the quantum register itself by adding
    and deleting subsystems. The Program keeps track of these changes (using
    :class:`RegRef` instances that represent the register)
    as they are appended to it in order to be able to report register
    reference errors as soon as they happen.

    Program `p2` can be run after Program `p1` if the RegRef state at the end of `p1` matches the
    RegRef state at the start of `p2`. This can be enforced by constructing `p2` as an explicit
    successor of `p1`, in which case the regrefs are copied over.
    When a Program is run or it obtains a successor, it is locked and no more Commands can be appended to it.
