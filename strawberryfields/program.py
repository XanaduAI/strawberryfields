This module implements the :class:`.Program` class which acts as a representation for quantum circuits.

Quantum circuit representation
------------------------------

The :class:`.Command` instances in the circuit form a
`strict partially ordered set <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Strict_and_non-strict_partial_orders>`_
in the sense that the order in which the operations have to be executed is usually not completely fixed.
For example, operations acting on different subsystems always commute with each other.
We denote :math:`a < b` if :math:`a` has to be executed before :math:`b`.
Each strict partial order corresponds to a
`directed acyclic graph <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_ (DAG),
and the transitive closure of any DAG is a strict partial order.
Three different (but equivalent) representations of the circuit are used.

* Initially, the circuit is represented as a Command queue (list), listing the Commands in
  the temporal order they are applied.
* The second representation, grid, essentially mimics a quantum circuit diagram.
  It is a mapping from subsystem indices to lists of Commands touching that subsystem,
  where each list is temporally ordered.
* Finally, the quantum circuit can be represented using a DAG by making each Command a node,
  and drawing an edge from each Command to all its immediate followers along each wire it touches.
  It can be converted back into a command queue by popping a maximal element until the graph
  is empty, that is, consuming it in a topological order.
  Note that a topological order is not always unique, there may be several equivalent topological orders.

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.program_utils

The three representations can be converted to each other
using the functions :func:`list_to_grid`, :func:`grid_to_DAG` and :func:`DAG_to_list`.

class Program:
    """Represents a photonic quantum circuit.

    The program class provides a context manager for:

    * accessing the quantum register associated with the program, and
    * appending :doc:`/introduction/ops` to the program.

    Within the context, operations are appended to the program using the
    Python-embedded Blackbird syntax

    .. code-block:: python3

        ops.GateName(arg1, arg2, ...) | (q[i], q[j], ...)

    where ``ops.GateName`` is a valid quantum operation, and ``q`` is a list
    of the programs quantum modes.
    All operations are appended to the program in the order they are
    listed within the context.

    In addition, some 'meta-operations' (such as :func:`~.New` and :attr:`~.Del`)
    are provided to modify the programs quantum register itself by adding
    and deleting subsystems.

    .. note::

        Two programs can be run successively on the same engine if and only if
        the number of registers at the end of the first program matches the
        number of modes at the beginning of the second program.

        This can be enforced by constructing the second program as an explicit
        successor of the first, in which case the registers are directly copied over.

        When a Program is run or it obtains a successor, it is locked and no more
        operations can be appended to it.

    **Example:**

    .. code-block:: python3

        import strawberryfields as sf
        from strawberryfields import ops

        # create a 3 mode quantum program
        prog = sf.Program(3)

        with prog.context as q:
            ops.Sgate(0.54) | q[0]
            ops.Sgate(0.54) | q[1]
            ops.Sgate(0.54) | q[2]
            ops.BSgate(0.43, 0.1) | (q[0], q[2])
            ops.BSgate(0.43, 0.1) | (q[1], q[2])
            ops.MeasureFock() | q

    The currently active register references can be accessed using the :meth:`~Program.register` method.

    .. note::

            The ``Program`` equality operation (e.g., ``prog_1 == prog_2``) does not account for
            logically equivalent programs where the order of operations or modes do not matter. It
            simply checks that the operations and parameters are identically applied. For a more
            thorough check, use the ``Program.equivalence()`` method instead.

        The compilation process can involve up to three stages:

        1. **Validation:** Validates properties of the program, including number of modes and
           allowed operations, making sure all the :doc:`/introduction/ops` used are accepted by the
           compiler.

        2. **Decomposition:** Once the program has been validated, decomposition are performed,
           transforming certain gates into sequences of simpler gates.

        3. **General compilation:** Finally, the compiler might specify bespoke compilation logic
           for transforming the  quantum circuit into an equivalent circuit which can be executed
           by the target device.

        **Example:**

        The ``gbs`` compile target will
        compile a circuit consisting of Gaussian operations and Fock measurements
        into canonical Gaussian boson sampling form.

        >>> prog2 = prog.compile(compiler="gbs")

        For a hardware device a :class:`~.Device` object, and optionally a specified compile strategy,
        must be supplied. If no compile strategy is supplied the default compiler from the device
        specification is used.

                to use. If a device is specified, this overrides the compile strategy specified by
                the hardware :class:`~.Device`.

        Keyword Args:
            optimize (bool): If True, try to optimize the program by merging and canceling gates.
                The default is False.
            warn_connected (bool): If True, the user is warned if the quantum circuit is not weakly
                connected. The default is True.
            shots (int): Number of times the program measurement evaluation is repeated. Passed
