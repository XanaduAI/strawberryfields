This module provides a class that represents the result of a quantum computation.

class Result:
    """Result of a quantum computation.

    Represents the results of the execution of a quantum program on a local or
    remote backend.

    The returned :class:`~Result` object provides several useful properties
    for accessing the results of your program execution:

    * ``results.state``: The quantum state object contains details and methods
      for manipulation of the final circuit state. Not available for remote
      backends. See :doc:`/introduction/states` for more information regarding available
      state methods.

    * ``results.samples``: Measurement samples from any measurements performed.

    **Example:**

    The following example runs an existing Strawberry Fields
    quantum :class:`~.Program` on the Gaussian backend to get
    a ``Result`` object.

    Using this ``Result`` object, the measurement samples
    can be returned, as well as quantum state information.

    >>> eng = sf.Engine("gaussian")
    >>> results = eng.run(prog)
    >>> print(results)
    Result: 3 subsystems
        state: <GaussianState: num_modes=3, pure=True, hbar=2>
        samples: [[0, 0, 0]]
    >>> results.samples
    np.array([[0, 0, 0]])
    >>> results.state.is_pure()
    True

    .. note::

        Only local simulators will return a state object. Remote
        simulators and hardware backends will return
        measurement samples  (:attr:`Result.samples`),
        but the return value of ``Result.state`` will be ``None``.
