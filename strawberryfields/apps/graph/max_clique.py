Maximum clique
==============

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.apps.graph.max_clique`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.apps.graph.max_clique

This module provides tools for users to identify large cliques in graphs. A clique is a subgraph
where all nodes are connected to each other. The maximum clique problem is to identify the
largest clique in a graph. The problem is NP-Hard in a worst-case setting, which is why it is
valuable to develop better algorithms to tackle it.

The core of this module is a local search algorithm that proceeds as follows:

#. A small clique in the graph is identified. The initial clique can be a single node, or it can
   be obtained by shrinking a random subgraph, for example obtained from GBS.
#. The clique is grown as much as possible by adding nodes connected to all nodes in the clique.
#. When no more growth is possible, a node in the clique is swapped with a node outside of it.

Steps 2-3 are repeated until a pre-determined number of steps have been completed, or until no
more growth or swaps are possible.

def local_search(clique: list, graph: nx.Graph, iterations, node_select: str = "uniform") -> list:
    """Local search algorithm for identifying large cliques.

    This function implements a version of the local search algorithm given in
    :cite:`pullan2006dynamic` and :cite:`pullan2006phased`. It proceeds by iteratively applying
    phases of greedy growth and plateau search to the input clique subgraph.

    **Growth phase**

    Growth is achieved using the :func:`~.clique_grow` function, which repeatedly evaluates the
    set :math:`C_0` of nodes in the remainder of the graph that are connected to all nodes in the
    clique, and selects one candidate node from :math:`C_0` to make a larger clique.

    **Search phase**

    Plateau search is performed with the :func:`~.clique_swap` function, which evaluates the set
    :math:`C_1` of nodes in the remainder of the graph that are connected to all but one of the
    nodes in the clique. The function then proceeds to select one candidate from :math:`C_1` and
    swap it with its corresponding node in the clique.

    Whenever the sets :math:`C_0` and :math:`C_1` used during growth and swapping have more than
    one element, there must be a choice of which node to add or swap. This choice is specified
    with the ``node_select`` argument, with node selection based on uniform randomness and node
    degree supported. Degree-based node selection involves picking the node with the greatest
    degree, with ties settled by uniform random choice.

    **Stopping**

    The iterative applications of growth and search are applied until either the specified number
    of iterations has been carried out or when a dead end has been reached. The function reaches
    a dead end when it is unable to perform any new swaps or growth.

    **Example usage:**

    >>> graph = nx.lollipop_graph(4, 1)
    >>> graph.add_edge(4, 2)
    >>> clique = [3, 4]
    >>> local_search(clique, graph, iterations=10)
    [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Args:
        clique (list[int]): a subgraph specified by a list of nodes; the subgraph must be a clique
        graph (nx.Graph): the input graph
        iterations (int): number of steps in the algorithm
        node_select (str): method of selecting nodes during swap and growth. Can be either
            ``"uniform"`` for uniform random selection or ``"degree"`` for degree-based selection.
            Defaults to ``"uniform"``

    Returns:
       list[int]: the largest cliques found by the algorithm
