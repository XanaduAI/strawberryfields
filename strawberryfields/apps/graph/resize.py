Graph resizing
==============

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.apps.graph.resize`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.apps.graph.resize

This module provides functionality for resizing of subgraphs. Samples from
:func:`~strawberryfields.apps.sample.quantum_sampler` have a variable number of clicks (
equivalently, the number of ones for samples with threshold detection). This results in subgraphs of
a random size in :func:`~strawberryfields.apps.graph.sample.dense_subgraph_sampler_gbs`.
However, some algorithms may want to work with subgraphs of a fixed size, necessitating the
resizing of sample subgraphs.

Resizing functionality is provided by the :func:`resize_subgraphs` function, allowing the user to
make use of different methods for resizing. The available methods are specified in
:func:`resize_subgraphs`.
