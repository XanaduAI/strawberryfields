Graph functions
===============

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.apps.graph.utils`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.apps.graph.utils

This module provides some ancillary functions for dealing with graphs. This includes graph
validation functions such as :func:`is_undirected`, :func:`validate_graph` and :func:`is_subgraph`;
clique-based utility functions :func:`is_clique`, :func:`c_0` and :func:`c_1`; and a utility
function to return the adjacency matrix of a subgraph, :func:`subgraph_adjacency`.

Furthermore, ``graph_type = Union[nx.Graph, np.ndarray]`` is defined here as an input type that
can be either a NetworkX graph or an adjacency matrix in the form of a NumPy array. Some
functions in this module are able to accept either input.
