Graph functions
===============

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.apps.graph.utils`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.apps.graph.utils

This module provides some ancillary functions for dealing with graphs. This includes
:func:`is_undirected` to check if an input matrix corresponds to an undirected graph (i.e.,
is symmetric) and :func:`subgraph_adjacency` to return the adjacency matrix of a subgraph when an
input graph and subset of nodes is specified.

Furthermore, the frontend :func:`~strawberryfields.apps.graph.dense_subgraph.find_dense`
function allows users to input graphs both as a `NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`__ array
containing the adjacency matrix and as a `NetworkX <https://networkx.github.io/>`__ ``Graph``
object. The :func:`validate_graph` function allows both inputs to be processed into a NetworkX
Graph for ease of processing.
