Tools for training variational GBS devices.

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.apps.train

A GBS device can be treated as a variational quantum device with trainable squeezing,
beamsplitter and rotation gates. This module provides the functionality for training a GBS device
using the approach outlined in `this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04770>`__
:cite:`banchi2020training`.

Embedding trainable parameters in GBS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Training algorithms for GBS distributions rely on the :math:`WAW` parametrization, where :math:`W`
is a diagonal matrix of weights and :math:`A` is a symmetric matrix. Trainable parameters are
embedded into the GBS distribution by expressing the weights as functions of the parameters.

This module contains methods to implement such embeddings. It also provides derivatives
of the weights with respect to the trainable parameters. There are two main classes, each
corresponding to a different embedding. The :class:`Exp` class is a simple embedding where the
weights are exponentials of the trainable parameters. The :class:`ExpFeatures` class is a more
general embedding that makes use of user-defined feature vectors, which potentially provide more
flexibility in training strategies.

As we have discussed, the above embeddings output weights that are used within the :math:`W`
matrix of the :math:`WAW` parametrization of GBS. This model of variational GBS is made available
as the :class:`VGBS` class.

For example, a four-mode variational model can be constructed using:

>>> from strawberryfields.apps import data
>>> data = data.Mutag0()
>>> embedding = Exp(data.modes)
>>> n_mean = 5
>>> vgbs = VGBS(data.adj, 5, embedding, threshold=False, samples=np.array(data[:1000]))

We can then evaluate properties of the variational GBS distribution for different choices of
trainable parameters:

>>> params = 0.1 * np.ones(data.modes)
>>> vgbs.n_mean(params)

Additional functionality related to the variational GBS model is available.

Choosing a cost function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the context of stochastic optimization, cost functions are expressed as expectation values
over the GBS distribution. Within the WAW parametrization, gradients of cost functions can also be
expressed as expectation values over the GBS distribution. This module contains methods for
calculating these gradients and for using gradient-based methods to optimize GBS circuits. In the
case of optimization with respect to a Kullback-Leibler divergence or log-likelihood cost
function, gradients can be computed efficiently, leading to fast training.
