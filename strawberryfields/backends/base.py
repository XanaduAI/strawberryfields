Backend API
===================================================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.backends.base`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.backends.base

This module implements the backend API. It contains the classes

* :class:`BaseBackend`
* :class:`BaseFock`
* :class:`BaseGaussian`

as well as a few methods which apply only to the Gaussian backend.

.. note:: The backend API is :math:`\hbar` independent.
          Internally the Strawberry Fields backends use :math:`\hbar=2`.


.. note::
    Keyword arguments are denoted ``**kwargs``, and allow additional
    options to be passed to the backends - these are documented where
    available. For more details on available keyword arguments, please
    consult the backends directly.

Fock backends
------------------

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.backends.base


Some methods are only implemented in the subclass :class:`FockBackend`,
which is the base class for simulators using a Fock-state representation
for quantum optical circuits.

    get_cutoff_dim

Gaussian backends
---------------------

Likewise, some methods are only implemented in subclass :class:`BaseGaussian`,
which is the base class for simulators using a Gaussian symplectic representation
for quantum optical circuits.

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.backends.base.BaseGaussian

.. autosummary::
    measure_heterodyne

           Hence the cubic phase gate `V(gamma)` is executed on a backend by scaling the
           `gamma` parameter by :math:`\sqrt{\hbar/2}` and then passing it to this method,
           much in the way the :math:`\hbar` dependent `X` and `Z` gates are implemented through the
           :math:`\hbar` independent :meth:`~BaseBackend.displacement` method.

        .. warning::
            The cubic phase gate can suffer heavily from numerical inaccuracies
            due to finite-dimensional cutoffs in the Fock basis. The gate
            implementation in Strawberry Fields is unitary, but it
            does not implement an exact cubic phase gate. The Kerr gate
            provides an alternative non-Gaussian gate.
