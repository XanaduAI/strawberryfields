        to the specified mode.

        .. note::
           This method is :math:`\hbar` independent.
           The usual definition of the cubic phase gate is :math:`\hbar` dependent:

           .. math::
              V(\gamma') = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma'}{3\hbar} \hat{x}^3\right) = \exp\left(i \frac{\gamma' \sqrt{\hbar/2}}{6} (\hat{a} +\hat{a}^\dagger)^3\right).

           Hence the cubic phase gate :math:`V(\gamma')` is executed on a backend by scaling the
           :math:`\gamma'` parameter by :math:`\sqrt{\hbar/2}` and then passing it to this method,
           much in the way the :math:`\hbar` dependent `X` and `Z` gates are implemented through the
           :math:`\hbar` independent :meth:`~BaseBackend.displacement` method.

        .. warning::
            The cubic phase gate can suffer heavily from numerical inaccuracies
            due to finite-dimensional cutoffs in the Fock basis. The gate
            implementation in Strawberry Fields is unitary, but it
            does not implement an exact cubic phase gate. The Kerr gate
            provides an alternative non-Gaussian gate.
