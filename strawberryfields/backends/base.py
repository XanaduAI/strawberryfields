Backend API
===================================================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.backends.base`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.backends.base

This module implements the backend API. It contains the classes

* :class:`BaseBackend`
* :class:`BaseFock`
* :class:`BaseGaussian`

as well as a few methods which apply only to the Gaussian backend.

.. note:: The Strawberry Fields backends by default assume :math:`\hbar=2`, however
    different conventions may be chosen when calling :meth:`~.BaseBackend.begin_circuit`

.. note::
    Keyword arguments are denoted ``**kwargs``, and allow additional
    options to be passed to the backends - these are documented where
    available. For more details on available keyword arguments, please
    consult the backends directly.

which is the base class for simulators using a Fock-state representation
for quantum optical circuits.

---------------------

Likewise, some commands are only implemented in subclass :class:`BaseGaussian`,
which is the base class for simulators using a Gaussian symplectic representation
for quantum optical circuits.

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.backends.base.BaseGaussian

.. autosummary::
