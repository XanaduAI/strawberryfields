**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.engine`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.engine

This module implements :class:`BaseEngine` and its subclasses that are responsible for
communicating quantum programs represented by :class:`.Program` objects
to a backend that could be e.g., a simulator or a hardware quantum processor.
One can think of each BaseEngine instance as a separate quantum computation.

A typical use looks like

.. include:: example_use.rst

LocalEngine methods

    The following are internal BaseEngine methods. In most cases the user should not
    call these directly.
