Quantum compiler engine
========================================================

**Module name:** :mod:`strawberryfields.engine`

.. currentmodule:: strawberryfields.engine

The :class:`Engine` class is responsible for communicating
quantum programs represented by :class:`.Program` objects
to a backend that could be e.g., a simulator, a hardware quantum processor, or a circuit drawer.

A typical use looks like
::

  prog = sf.Program(num_subsystems)
  with prog.context as q:
      Coherent(0.5)  | q[0]
      Vac            | q[1]
      Sgate(2)       | q[1]
      Dgate(0.5)     | q[0]
      BSgate(1)      | q[0:2]
      Dgate(0.5).H   | q[0]
      Measure        | q
  eng = sf.Engine(backend='fock')
  eng.run(prog, cutoff_dim=5)
  v1 = prog.register[1].val
