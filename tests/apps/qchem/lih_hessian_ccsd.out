 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 THE NUMBER OF ENERGIES AT DISPLACED GEOMETRIES WILL BE        72 AT MOST,
 BUT ADDITIONAL SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS TO BE MADE AT EACH

 A CHECK JOB WILL PRINT THE PRECISE NUMBER OF POINTS NEEDED.
 WITHOUT SYMMETRY, THE NUMBER OF ENERGIES NEEDED WOULD BE     120

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE

 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE

 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE

 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE

 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE

 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1

 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 PARALLEL CODE WRITTEN BY RYAN M. OLSON AND JONATHAN L. BENTZ,
 BASED ON SERIAL CODE OF P.PIECUCH, S.A.KUCHARSKI, K.KOWALSKI, M.MUSIAL

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.

 1A.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR PROCESS-BASED CCSD IS        45279 WORDS.
 1B.  REPLICATED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR    NODE-BASED CCSD IS        45183 WORDS.
 THIS RUN WILL USE        45183 WORDS OF REPLICATED MEMORY.
 2.       SHARED MEMORY REQUIRED FOR THE CCSD ITERS IS               61 WORDS.
 3.  DISTRIBUTED MEMORY FOR THIS JOB IS MEMDDI=       1 MWORDS.

 EXPLANATION (WHAT TO PUT IN $SYSTEM INPUT):
 1. THE PROCESS-BASED PARALLEL CCSD WILL BE CHOSEN IF MWORDS=       1,
    OTHERWISE, ENTER MWORDS=       1 TO RUN THE NODE-BASED PARALLEL CCSD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED BY EVERY COMPUTE PROCESS, SO THE SECOND, SMALLER VALUE
    IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WISER CHOICE.
 2. THIS MEMORY CLASS PRESENTLY HAS NO INPUT KEYWORD.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONCE PER NODE, OUT OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM'S SYSV MEMORY.
 3. THIS VALUE INCLUDES THE INTEGRAL TRANSFORMATION'S DISTRIBUTED MEMORY,
    SO MEMDDI=      1 SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE ENTIRE JOB.
    IT IS ALLOCATED ONLY ONCE, FOR THE WHOLE RUN, SPREAD ACROSS ALL NODES.

 THIS JOB IS USING   1 NODES, WITH  2 PROCESSES/NODE,
 USING INPUT MEMORY VALUES MWORDS=     900 AND MEMDDI=       2
 MOST EFFICIENT VALUES ARE MWORDS=       1 AND MEMDDI=       1
 THE INPUT VALUES MEANS EACH SMP NODE WILL ALLOCATE      23 MBYTES OF MEMORY.
