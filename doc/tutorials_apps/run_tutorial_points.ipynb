        "\n\nPoint processes\n===============\n\n*Technical details are available in the API documentation:* :doc:`/code/api/strawberryfields.apps.points`\n\nThis section shows how to generate GBS point process samples and use them to detect outlier\npoints in a data set. Point processes are models for generating random point patterns and can be\nuseful in machine learning, providing a source of randomness with\npreference towards both diversity :cite:`kulesza2012determinantal` and similarity in data. GBS\ndevices can be programmed to operate as special types of point processes that generate clustered\nrandom point patterns :cite:`jahangiri2019point`.\n\nThe probability of generating a specific pattern of points in GBS point processes depends on\nmatrix functions of a kernel matrix $K$ that describes the similarity between the points.\nMatrix functions that appear in GBS point processes are typically\n`permanents <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)>`__ and\n`hafnians <https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hafnian.html>`__. Here we use\nthe permanental point process, in which the probability of observing a pattern of points $S$\ndepends on the permanent of their corresponding kernel submatrix $K_S$ as\n:cite:`jahangiri2019point`:\n\n\\begin{align}\\mathcal{P}(S) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha(S)}\\text{per}(K_S),\\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a normalization function that depends on $S$ and the average number\nof points. Let's look at a simple example to better understand the permanental point process.\n\n"

Now consider a specific point pattern in which all points\nare close to each other, which simply means that their matrix elements have larger entries. The\npermanent of a matrix is a sum over the product of some matrix entries. Therefore,\nthe submatrix that corresponds to those points has a large permanent and the probability of\nobserving them in a sample is larger.\n\nFor kernel matrices that are positive-semidefinite, such as the RBF kernel, there exist efficient\nquantum-inspired classical algorithms for permanental point process sampling\n:cite:`jahangiri2019point`. In this tutorial we use positive-semidefinite kernels and the\nquantum-inspired classical algorithm.\n\nLet's construct the RBF kernel with the parameter $\\sigma$ set to 2.5.\n\n"

        "Outlier Detection\n-----------------\n\nWhen the distribution of points in a given space is inhomogeneous, GBS point processes\nsample points from the dense regions with higher probability. This feature of the GBS point\nprocesses can be used to detect outlier points in a data set. In this example, we create two\ndense clusters and place them in a two-dimensional space containing some randomly distributed\npoints in the background. We consider the random background points as outliers to the clustered\npoints and show that the permanental point process selects points from the dense clusters with\na higher probability.\n\nWe first create the data points. The clusters have 50 points each and the points have a\nstandard deviation of 0.3. The clusters are centered at $[x = 2, y = 2]$ and $[x = 4,\ny = 4]$, respectively.
