        "\n\nDense Subgraphs\n===============\n\n*Technical details are available in the API documentation:* :doc:`/code/api/strawberryfields.apps.subgraph`\n\nGraphs can be used to model a wide variety of concepts: social networks, financial markets,\nbiological networks, and many others. A common problem of interest is to find subgraphs that\ncontain a large number of connections between their nodes. These subgraphs may correspond to\ncommunities in social networks, correlated assets in a market, or mutually influential proteins\nin a biological network.\n\nMathematically, this task is known as the `dense subgraph problem\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subgraph>`__. The density of a $k$-node subgraph is equal\nto the number of its edges divided by the maximum possible number of edges.\nIdentifying the densest graph of a given size, known as the densest-$k$ subgraph problem,\nis `NP-Hard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness>`__.\n\n\nAs shown in :cite:`arrazola2018using`, a defining feature of GBS is that when we encode a graph\ninto a GBS device, it samples dense subgraphs with high probability. This property can be\nused to find dense subgraphs by sampling from a GBS device and postprocessing the outputs.\nLet's take a look!\n\nFinding dense subgraphs\n-----------------------\nThe first step is to import all required modules. We'll need the :mod:`~.apps.data`\nmodule to load pre-generated samples, the :mod:`~.apps.sample` module to postselect samples, the\n:mod:`~.apps.subgraph` module to search for dense subgraphs, and the :mod:`~.apps.plot` module to\nvisualize the graphs. We'll also use Plotly which is required for the :mod:`~.apps.plot` module and\nNetworkX for graph operations.\n\n"

        "Here we'll study a 30-node graph with a planted 10-node graph, as considered in\n:cite:`arrazola2018using`. The graph is generated by joining two Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graphs. The\nfirst graph of 20 nodes is created with edge probability of 0.5. The second planted\ngraph is generated with edge probability of 0.875. The planted nodes are the last ten nodes in the\ngraph. The two graphs are joined by selecting 8 nodes at random from both graphs and adding an\nedge between them. This graph has the sneaky property that even though the planted subgraph is the\ndensest of its size, its nodes have a lower average degree than the nodes in the rest of the\ngraph.\n\nThe :mod:`~.apps.data` module has pre-generated GBS samples from this graph. Let's load them,\npostselect on samples with a large number of clicks, and convert them to subgraphs:\n\n"
