Operations
==========

Strawberry Fields supports a wide variety of photonic quantum operations --- including gates,
state preparations and measurements. These operations are used to construct quantum programs,
as in the following example:

.. code-block:: python3

    with prog.context as q:
        Fock(2)       | q[0]
        Fock(3)       | q[1]
        BSgate()      | (q[0], q[1])
        MeasureFock() | q[0]

This program uses Fock state preparation (:class:`~.ops.Fock`), beamsplitters (:class:`~.BSgate`),
and a photon number resolving detector (:class:`~.MeasureFock`).

Below is a list of all quantum operations supported by Strawberry Fields.

.. note::

    In the Strawberry Fields we use the convention :math:`\hbar=2` by default, however
    this can be changed using the global variable :py:data:`sf.hbar`.

    See :ref:`conventions` for more details.
