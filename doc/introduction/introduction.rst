Strawberry Fields is an open-source framework for photonic quantum computing.
In particular, Strawberry Fields allows for the following workflows:

* Construct and simulate continuous-variable quantum photonic circuits.
  Provided simulators include highly optimized Gaussian, Fock, and Bosonic
  numeric backends, as well as a TensorFlow backend for backpropagation.

* Compile and submit photonic circuits for remote execution on Xanadu's quantum hardware,
  retrieve your results, and manage multiple jobs.

* Use our high-level functions for graph and network optimization, machine learning, and
  chemistry applications --- all executable on near-term hardware.

Get started
-----------

Follow the `installation <../_static/install.html>`_ page to get Strawberry Fields up and
running, then have a look at our quickstart guides, or jump over to the
:doc:`tutorials <demonstrations>` to see what you can do with Strawberry Fields.

Users interested in applications of photonic quantum computers should check
out the :doc:`applications` pages. Those wanting to dig deeper into the design
of circuits can head to the :doc:`/introduction/circuits` page.

Developers can head to the :doc:`/development/development_guide` to see how
they can contribute to Strawberry Fields.
