Chemistry
=========

Quantum computers are naturally suited to simulating chemical systems, where processes and
interactions on the atomic level are **governed by quantum mechanics**. One use-case for photonic
devices is to study **how materials absorb light** at different frequencies. These absorption
spectra can be useful for tasks such as solar cell optimization or in pharmaceuticals.
