Chemistry
=========

Quantum computers are naturally suited to simulating chemical systems, where the laws of quantum
mechanics govern interactions. Near-term photonic devices are well-suited to simulating
absorption spectra of molecules, which can be useful in chemistry and pharmaceuticals for taks
such as optimizing solar cells.
