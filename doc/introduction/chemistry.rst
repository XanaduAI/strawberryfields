Quantum computers are naturally suited to simulating chemical systems, where processes and
interactions on the atomic level are **governed by quantum mechanics**. One use-case for photonic
devices is to study **how materials absorb light** at different frequencies. These absorption
spectra can be useful for tasks such as solar cell optimization or in pharmaceuticals. Strawberry
Fields allows you to reconstruct vibronic absorption spectra simply by inputting chemical
properties of the molecule being considered.
