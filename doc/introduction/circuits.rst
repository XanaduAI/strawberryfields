In Strawberry Fields, photonic quantum circuits are represented as :class:`.Program`
objects. By creating a program, quantum operations can be applied, measurements performed,
and the program can then be simulated using the various Strawberry Fields backends.

    of some of the terms used in Strawberry Fields.

Creating a quantum program
--------------------------

To construct a photonic quantum circuit in Strawberry Fields, a :class:`.Program` object
must be created, and operations applied.

.. code-block:: python3

    import strawberryfields as sf
    from strawberryfields import ops

    # create a 3-mode quantum program
    prog = sf.Program(3)

    with prog.context as q:
        ops.Sgate(0.54) | q[0]
        ops.Sgate(0.54) | q[1]
        ops.Sgate(0.54) | q[2]
        ops.BSgate(0.43, 0.1) | (q[0], q[2])
        ops.BSgate(0.43, 0.1) | (q[1], q[2])
        ops.MeasureFock() | q

Here, we are creating a 3-mode program, and applying a :class:`.Sgate` and
a :class:`.BSgate` to various modes. Constructing quantum circuits always follows
the same structure as the above example; in particular,

* A ``with`` statement is used to populate the program with quantum operations.

* :attr:`Program.context` is used within the ``with`` statement to return ``q``,
  a representation of the quantum registers (qumodes or modes).

* Quantum operations are applied to the modes of the program using the syntax

  .. code-block:: python3

      ops.GateName(arg1, arg2) | (q[i], q[j], ...)

  where ``ops.GateName`` is a quantum operation, ``arg1, arg2`` are its parameters,
  and the right-hand side of the vertical bar lists the qumode(s) on which the operation
  will act.

.. note::

    The contents of a program can be viewed by calling the :meth:`.Program.print` method,
    or output as a qcircuit :math:`\LaTeX{}` document by using the :meth:`.Program.draw_circuit`
    method.

    Visit the :doc:`ops` page to see an overview of available quantum operations.

    Strawberry Fields also provides support for constructing and simulating photonic
    time domain multiplexing algorithms. For more details, please see :class:`~.TDMProgram`.


Simulating your program
-----------------------

Strawberry Fields provides several backend simulators for simulating
your quantum program. To access the simulators, an **engine** must be initialized,
which is responsible for executing the program on a specified backend
(which can be either a local simulator, or a remote simulator/hardware device).

.. code-block:: python3

    # intialize the fock backend with a
    # Fock cutoff dimension (truncation) of 5
    eng = sf.Engine("fock", backend_options={"cutoff_dim": 5})

:class:`.Engine` accepts two arguments, the backend name, and a dictionary of
backend options. Available backends include:

* The ``'fock'`` backend, written in NumPy.

  This backend represents the quantum state
  and operations via the Fock basis, so can represent all possible CV states and
  operations. However numerical error is also introduced due to truncation of the Fock
  spaceâ€”increasing the cutoff results in higher accuracy at a cost of increased memory consumption.

* The ``'gaussian'`` backend, written in NumPy.

  This backend represents the quantum
  state as a Gaussian, and operations as quantum operations. It is numerically exact,
  and consumes less memory and is less computationally intensive then the Fock backends.
  However, it cannot represent non-Gaussian operations and states, with the exception of
  terminal Fock measurements.

* The ``'tf'`` backend, written in TensorFlow 2.

  This backend represents the quantum
  state and operations via the Fock basis, but allows for backpropagation and optimization
  using TensorFlow.

  .. note::

      To instantiate an engine with the TensorFlow backend, TensorFlow 2.0 and above
      must be installed. In most cases, TensorFlow can be installed via ``pip``:

      .. code-block:: console

          pip install tensorflow

      For more installation details and instructions, please refer to the
      `TensorFlow documentation <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_.


Once the engine has been initialized, the quantum program can be executed on the
selected backend via :meth:`.Engine.run`:

.. code-block:: python3

    result = eng.run(prog)

Execution results
-----------------

The returned :class:`.Result` object provides several useful properties
for accessing the results of your program execution:

* :attr:`.Result.state`: The quantum state object contains details and methods
  for manipulation of the final circuit state. Not available for remote
  backends.

  .. code-block:: python

      >>> print(result.state)
      <FockState: num_modes=3, cutoff=5, pure=True, hbar=2.0>
      >>> state = result.state
      >>> state.trace()    # trace of the quantum state
      0.9999999999999999
      >>> state.dm().shape # density matrix
      (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5)

* :attr:`.Result.samples`: Measurement samples from any measurements performed.

  .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> results.samples
      [0, 0, 2]

.. seealso::

    Visit the :doc:`states` page to see an overview of available quantum state methods.


.. note::

    Measured modes will always be returned to the vacuum state.

.. warning::

    To avoid significant numerical error when working with Fock backends, ensure that
    the trace of your program after simulation remains reasonably close to 1,
    by calling :meth:`state.trace() <.BaseFockState.trace>`. If the trace is much less than 1, you
    will need to increase the cutoff dimension.


Symbolic parameters
-------------------

The quantum operations can take both numerical and symbolic parameters.
The latter fall into two types:

* **Measured parameters**: Certain quantum programs (e.g. quantum teleportation) require that
  operations can be conditioned on measurement results obtained during the execution of the
  program. In this case the parameter value is not known until the measurement is made
  (or simulated). The latest measurement result of qumode ``i`` is available via ``q[i].par``.

* **Free parameters**: A *parametrized circuit template* is a program that
  depends on a number of free parameters. These parameters can be bound to new fixed
  values each time the program is executed.
  The free parameters are created and accessed using the
  :meth:`.Program.params` method.

The symbolic parameters can be combined and transformed using basic algebraic operations, and
the mathematical functions in the :data:`strawberryfields.math` namespace.

.. code-block:: python3

    import strawberryfields as sf
    from strawberryfields import ops

    # create a 2-mode quantum program
    prog = sf.Program(2)

    # create a free parameter named 'a'
    a = prog.params('a')

    # define the program
    with prog.context as q:
        ops.Dgate(a ** 2)    | q[0]  # free parameter
        ops.MeasureX         | q[0]  # measure qumode 0, the result is used in the next operation
        ops.Sgate(1 - sf.math.sin(q[0].par)) | q[1]  # measured parameter
        ops.MeasureFock()    | q[1]

    # intialize the Fock backend
    eng = sf.Engine('fock', backend_options={'cutoff_dim': 5})

    # run the program, with the free parameter 'a' bound to the value 0.9
    result = eng.run(prog, args={'a': 0.9})

.. warning::

    When using the TensorFlow backend, all Tensor and Variable objects **must** be
    passed to gates by using a free parameter, and binding the Tensor/Variable
    on engine execution. For more details, see :doc:`demos/run_tutorial_machine_learning`.


Compilation
-----------

The :class:`.Program` object also provides the :meth:`.Program.compile` method that
automatically transforms your circuit into an :term:`equivalent circuit` with
a particular layout or topology. For example, the ``gbs`` compile target will
compile a circuit consisting of Gaussian operations and Fock measurements
into canonical Gaussian boson sampling form.

>>> prog2 = prog.compile(compiler="gbs")

Programs can also be compiled for specific hardware devices using the Xanadu Cloud platform.
After instantiating a remote engine for the target hardware, the device specifications
can be accessed and used for compilation using the ``device`` keyword argument:

>>> eng = sf.RemoteEngine("X8")
>>> device = eng.device_spec
>>> prog2 = prog.compile(device=device)

If no compile strategy is supplied, the default compiler from the device
specification is used. This can be overridden by also providing the compiler to be used:

>>> prog2 = prog.compile(device=device, compiler="Xunitary")

For the ``X``-series of chips, available compilers include:
